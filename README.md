    Geometry Calculator

    1.  Calculate the area of a Circle
    2.  Calculate the area of a Rectangle
    3.  Calculate the area of a Triangle
    4.  Quit

  Enter your choice (1-4): 

If the user enters 1, the program should ask for the radius of the circle and then display its area.   Use 3.14159 for PI.
